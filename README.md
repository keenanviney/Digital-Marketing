# Digital-Marketing

A number of projects and helper scripts for digital marketing:

CV-app-master/flask-app - Prototype application to showcase a deep learning model that can classify display ads based on their image and resulting performance.

Computer_Vision_Deep_Learning - Jupyter Notebook that goes through how the images are pre-processed for the model and how the resulting deep neural network is trained.

MTA_parsing - Convenience script for parsing out Multi-Touch Attribution data.

Messages in Market - Analysis done that tried to understand whether there was an optimal number of messages to put into the market in various campaigns. The initial hypothesis was that too few messages would fail to resonate with enough consumer groups while too many massages would end up confusing individual consumers.

NLP post copy - Analysis of post copy language and how it relates to the performance of the ad.

OCR - A short script to assess whether it would be possible to extract text from banner ads, we found the results were too inconsistent for analysis.

Retail Analysis - Exploratory analysis of retail data from an online store. Implementation of an incremental sales metric and association rules.
